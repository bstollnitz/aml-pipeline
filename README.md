# How to train a model in Azure ML using components and a pipeline

This project shows how to train a Fashion MNIST model using a Azure ML components and a pipeline, and how to deploy it using a managed online endpoint. It uses MLflow for tracking and model representation.

## Setup

* You need to have an Azure subscription. You can get a [free subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free) to try it out.
* Create a [resource group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal).
* Create a new machine learning workspace by following the "Create the workspace" section of the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/quickstart-create-resources). Keep in mind that you'll be creating a "machine learning workspace" Azure resource, not a "workspace" Azure resource, which is entirely different!
* If you have access to GitHub Codespaces, click on the "Code" button in this GitHub repo, select the "Codespaces" tab, and then click on "New codespace."
* Alternatively, if you plan to use your local machine:
  * Install the Azure CLI by following the instructions in the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
  * Install the ML extension to the Azure CLI by following the "Installation" section of the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-configure-cli).
  * Install and activate the conda environment by executing the following commands:
  ```
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  conda activate aml_pipeline_cli
  ```
* In a terminal window, log in to Azure by executing `az login --use-device-code`. 
* Set your default subscription by executing `az account set -s "<YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME_OR_ID>"`. You can verify your default subscription by executing `az account show`, or by looking at `~/.azure/azureProfile.json`.
* Set your default resource group and workspace by executing `az configure --defaults group="<YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP>" workspace="<YOUR_WORKSPACE>"`. You can verify your defaults by executing `az configure --list-defaults` or by looking at `~/.azure/config`.
* You can now open the [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com/), where you'll be able to see and manage all the machine learning resources we'll be creating.
* Install the [Azure Machine Learning extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.vscode-ai), and log in to it by clicking on "Azure" in the left-hand menu, and then clicking on "Sign in to Azure."


## Training and inference on your development machine

* Under "Run and Debug" on VS Code's left navigation, choose the "Train locally" run configuration and press F5.
* Do the same for the "Test locally" run configuration.

You can look at the logs generated by the code in these files with the following command:

```
mlflow ui
```

* Make a local prediction using the trained mlflow model. You can use either csv or json files:

```
cd aml_pipeline_cli
mlflow models predict --model-uri "model" --input-path "test_data/images.csv" --content-type csv
mlflow models predict --model-uri "model" --input-path "test_data/images.json" --content-type json
```


## Training and deployment in the cloud

Create the compute cluster.

```
az ml compute create -f cloud/cluster-cpu.yml 
```

Create the dataset we'll use to train the model.

```
az ml data create -f cloud/data.yml 
```

Create the components.

```
az ml component create -f cloud/train.yml
az ml component create -f cloud/test.yml
```

Create and run the pipeline.

```
run_id=$(az ml job create -f cloud/pipeline-job.yml --query name -o tsv)
```

Go to the Azure ML Studio and wait until the Job completes.
You don't need to download the trained model, but here's how you would do it if you wanted to:

```
az ml job download --name $run_id --output-name "model_dir"
```

Create the Azure ML model from the output.

```
az ml model create --name model-pipeline-cli --version 1 --path "azureml://jobs/$run_id/outputs/model_dir" --type mlflow_model
```

Create the endpoint.

```
az ml online-endpoint create -f cloud/endpoint.yml
az ml online-deployment create -f cloud/deployment.yml --all-traffic
```

Invoke the endpoint.

```
az ml online-endpoint invoke --name endpoint-pipeline-cli --request-file test_data/images_azureml.json
```

Clean up the endpoint, to avoid getting charged.

```
az ml online-endpoint delete --name endpoint-pipeline-cli -y
```
